• Final Project: “RTL to GDS Implementation of Low Power Configurable Multi Clock Digital 
System”  
o Description: It is responsible of receiving commands through UART receiver to do different 
system functions as register file reading/writing or doing some processing using ALU block 
and send result to UART transmitter through asynchronous FIFO for handling different 
clock rates and avoid data loss.                  
o Project phases: - 
o RTL Design from Scratch of system blocks (ALU, Register File, Synchronous FIFO, 
Integer Clock Divider, Clock Gating, Synchronizers, Main Controller, UART TX, UART 
RX). 
o Integrate and verify functionality through self-checking testbench.  
o Constraining the system using synthesis TCL scripts. 
o Synthesize and optimize the design using design compiler tool. 
o Analyze Timing paths and fix setup and hold violations. 
o Verify Functionality equivalence using Formality tool 
o Physical implementation of the system passing through ASIC flow phases and 
generate the GDS File. 
o Verify functionality post-layout considering the actual delays.
